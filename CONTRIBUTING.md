# Contribution HowTo & Guidlines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

There are different ways to add to this list:
- fork this repo, add something, and create a pull request
- create an issue, to discuss what you want to add (or have added by us)
- contact the maintainers

## Adding through Pull Requests

We don't want to add too much formal rules for contributions right now
(though we might add some if the repo grows significantly and finds many
contributors). If you create a pull request, please make sure to stay
roughly consistent with the current syntax in README.md - but also if you
have a new idea, go for it. We don't have a fixed idea on how to best
structure all this information.

Generally a good procedure is to fork the repository, and then create a
new branch off main. There you can create as many commits as you need,
and when you are done, create the pull request to our repo's main branch.

> :bulb: **Hint**:<br>
> Not every single addition to the list requires a separate commit,
> but if you want to add and change a lot, it would make sense to do
> so over several commits.

In case you are unsure how to do a PR, just contact the maintainers before,
and we are happy to guide you through the process.
